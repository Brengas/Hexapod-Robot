# Hexapod Robot

This repository contains the design, code, and documentation for a hexapod robot controlled by an Arduino Nano and 18 servo motors. The project is currently a work in progress, with plans to upgrade to an ESP32 for enhanced control and connectivity.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To design and build a fully functional hexapod robot capable of walking and performing basic movement funcionalities, aditionally, this robot is ment to be driven by an ESP32 camera which will allow the robot to move through the enviroment, avoiding obstacles and functionalities like those.  
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino Nano, PCA9685 servo drivers, 18 servo motors, Fusion 360, 3D printing.  
- **Features**:  
  - 18 servo motors for movement across 6 legs.  
  - PCA9685 drivers for precise servo control.  
  - Custom-designed and 3D-printed mechanical components.
